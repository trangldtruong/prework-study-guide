## Description

This project is created to help computer science students have a system to take notes. In the beginning, learning to computer program can be overwhelming. Therefore, establishing a note taking system can be helpful. 
I have learned about basic html, css and javascript throughout developing this project.

Users can use the application for a variety of purposes such as taking note in their study, develop their own note taking system or upgrade the application for other usages.
